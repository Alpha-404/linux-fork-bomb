# Disclamer
This crashes your computer
# Usage
When you start forkbomb (using cmd : ./forkbomb) it will prompt you with "cool" this means it has started and you now should enter the access code 1569 (nice)
As soon as you enter the code it will instantly start taking up all the free ram in ur computer till it crashes :)
# Compiling on linux :
Open terminal in the folder that the source is in and type "g++ source.cpp"
If you dont have g++ install it with "sudo apt install g++"
If you are unsure about if you have it or not check with the command "g++"
